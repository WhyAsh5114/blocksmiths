# GitHub Prediction Markets - Usage Guide

A decentralized prediction market platform for GitHub pull requests with bonding curve token economics.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- MetaMask wallet installed and configured
- Some ETH for gas fees and trading
- Local blockchain running (Hardhat network on localhost:8545)

### Getting Started

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3001`
2. Click "Connect Wallet" in the top-right corner
3. Approve MetaMask connection
4. You're ready to trade!

## üìä Platform Overview

The platform combines two trading mechanisms:

- **Token Trading**: Buy/sell project tokens with bonding curve pricing
- **Prediction Markets**: Bet on GitHub PR outcomes (YES/NO)

## ü™ô Token Trading

### How It Works

- Each GitHub repository can have its own ERC-20 token
- Tokens use bonding curve pricing (price increases with supply)
- 10% of each purchase goes to the repository creator as rewards
- Tokens can be redeemed back for ETH at current bonding curve price

### Trading Flow

1. **Browse Tokens**
   - Go to Dashboard ‚Üí Tokens tab
   - View available project tokens
   - See current price, market cap, and supply

2. **Buy Tokens**
   - Select a token from the list
   - Enter the amount you want to buy
   - Click "Buy Tokens"
   - Confirm transaction in MetaMask
   - Tokens appear in your portfolio

3. **Sell Tokens**
   - Go to Portfolio ‚Üí Holdings
   - Find your token position
   - Click "Redeem" or use the sell interface
   - Receive ETH based on current bonding curve price

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Pricing**: Price automatically adjusts based on supply/demand
- **Creator Rewards**: Repository owners earn 10% on all token sales
- **Instant Liquidity**: Always able to buy/sell through the bonding curve
- **No Slippage Protection Needed**: Bonding curve provides guaranteed pricing

## üéØ Prediction Markets

### How It Works

- Each GitHub PR gets its own prediction market
- Users can bet YES (PR will merge) or NO (PR will be rejected/closed)
- Markets resolve based on actual GitHub PR outcomes
- Winners split the total pool proportionally to their stakes

### Trading Flow

1. **Browse Markets**
   - Go to Dashboard ‚Üí Predictions tab
   - View active prediction markets
   - See current YES/NO prices and volume

2. **Place Bets**
   - Select a market
   - Choose YES or NO position
   - Enter your ETH stake amount
   - Confirm transaction in MetaMask

3. **Market Resolution**
   - When PR is merged/closed on GitHub, market resolves
   - Check Portfolio ‚Üí Holdings for resolved positions
   - Click "Redeem" to claim winnings

### Market States

- **Active**: PR is still open, betting continues
- **Resolved - Merged**: PR was merged, YES voters win
- **Resolved - Closed**: PR was closed/rejected, NO voters win

## üí° Tips for Success

### Token Trading

- **Research Projects**: Invest in repositories with active development
- **Watch Creator Activity**: Active maintainers may drive token value
